1. What does it mean to think in react?

    Thinking in React is understanding how to make apps effectively, which is by starting with a mock product then  breaking it down to different component and adding states where needed.

1. Describe state.

    state determines how a component interacts with the page. Changing the state is the main thing done in React to make pages interactable.

1. Describe props.

    props are arguments that are passed to a function through JSX attribute in react. Without them the application wouldn't know what values to pass.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
    
    Side effects are what affect other elements or components that are outside of the scope of the function being called. useEffect will update state and prop changes.
